Hi, I'm Aidan Strong (he/him/his)!

I'm an LA based Game Designer and a current resident at the UCLA Game Lab. I'm passionate about inclusive design, interactive media, and player motivation.

In the past, I've used machine learning to mimic my personal journal entries, critiqued the software industry, and made people walk in circles. I'm currently working on an idle/incremental game.
